            CheckMySchool is a participatory monitoring initiative for the education sector in the Philippines. It aims to continuously improve the quality of education services by bringing the participation of citizens and communities into the governance of public schools in the country. It started in 2011 as an experimental partnership project with the Department of Education along the advocacy for access to information and social accountability. <br><br>
            The CheckMySchool Data Portal is a resource for the collection of data on the Philipppine Educaton System.
